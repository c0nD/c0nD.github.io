## Main Webpage

The main webpage contains information about who we are here at Onion!
<br>
Whether you're looking to join, or just want to take a look around; use this static site to get more info.

## Documentation Webpage

You can find a `standalone` webpage that contains everything you need to know about my [open source bot: Fluffy](https://github.com/c0nD/FluffyBOT).
<br>
This webpage contains anything you'd need to know to use Fluffy's commands, and to help your own users set it up for your own server.
<br>
If you're looking to set up this guild battle bot for Cookie Run: Kingdom, you can check the `README.md` of the open source repo.
